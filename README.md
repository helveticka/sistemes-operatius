# Sistemes Operatius

## Content
In this repository there are two directorys, each one storing the projects of the differents parts of the subject (SO I & SO II).

### SO_I

#### P1: my_lib functions
In this exercise, we coded string-related functions included in the C library "string.h". Furthermore, we also included stack-manager functions.

#### P2: mini shell
This is the main project, where we implemented a shell that can manage internal commands (jobs, fg, bg...) and external commands on a bash terminal. Each level includes the specified functions and their debug messages. The final version of my_shell works perfectly and properly manages different threads.

#### P3: threads and mutual exclusion
The final exercise's purpose is to access a stack with different threads and manipulate its elements while adhering to concurrency principles. In stack_counters we manage the stacks, and with reader.c we can print the stack information.
